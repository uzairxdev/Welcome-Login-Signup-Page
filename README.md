**Packages which are using:**

- flutter_svg: [link](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg)

I design 3 responsive screens first one is a welcome screen the user opens your app it shows then users have two options if the user has an account then press the login button and it just shifts the user to the login screen, or if they don't have an account then press signup button its transfers to the signup screen. All of those screens work perfectly on Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop.
